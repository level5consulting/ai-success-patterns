# AI Success Patterns - Backlog

Lower-priority site work, kept here so nothing is lost between sessions. Each item carries its full context so it can be picked up cold.

**Rule:** when an item is added, record what it is, why it matters, who raised it, any decisions or constraints already discussed, and open questions. Not just a title.

---

## 1. UI redesign

- **What:** A redesign of the aisuccesspatterns.com site.
- **Raised by:** Jeff Toppall (contributor).
- **Why:** Jeff recommended it in his feedback to Greg. His specific concerns with the current design were not recorded - capture them next time Jeff is consulted.
- **Constraints / known decisions:**
  - Greg prefers light color schemes.
  - Keep the established category tag colors, including `.tag-gov` (purple, `#6B3A8C` light / `#B07AD4` dark) for Governance.
  - Greg prefers a fresh redesign over incremental patching when direction shifts significantly.
  - `main` is live - redesign must be built on a branch and approved by Greg before merging.
- **Open questions:** What specifically did Jeff want changed (navigation, typography, layout, pattern page structure)?
- **Status:** Not started.

## 2. Red team published patterns 01-07 with Assemble the Team

- **What:** Run each of patterns 01-07 through the Assemble the Team red-team process, as was done for 09-11.
- **Raised by:** Greg.
- **Why:** Patterns 09-11 went through the full workflow (Build - Red team - Iterate - Commit) and improved as a result. 01-07 were published before that step existed, so they haven't had the same scrutiny.
- **Constraints / known decisions:**
  - Apply current conventions while revising: section order Problem - Value - Context - Solution - Notes; regular dashes, no em dashes; "Inspired by" prose attribution, no direct quotes.
  - Pattern 08 (Assemble the Team) is the pattern itself and is not in scope.
  - Changes go on a branch; Greg approves before merge.
- **Related:** Patterns 01-05 still have leftover `.md` drafts next to their `.html` pages (06-11 are HTML only). Decide whether to delete or keep them during this pass.
- **Status:** Not started.

## 3. Add more quoted sources

- **What:** Add more sourced material to patterns, systematically across the site.
- **Raised by:** Jeff Toppall (contributor).
- **Why:** Jeff recommended more quoted sources to strengthen the patterns' credibility.
- **Constraints / known decisions:**
  - **Tension to resolve:** current convention is "Inspired by" prose attribution with **no direct quotes** (e.g., the Kent Beck quote was removed from Pattern 09). Decide whether "quoted sources" means adding direct quotes, adding more cited/attributed sources in prose, or a references section.
  - Origin material is preserved in `sources/` (Kent Beck, Eric Olson, Justin MacBale, Shubham Dwivedi, Chris Gallivan).
- **Status:** Not started - needs a decision on the quoting approach first.

## 4. Contributor outreach - Shubham Dwivedi and Chris Gallivan

- **What:** Reach out to Shubham Dwivedi and Chris Gallivan as contributors.
- **Raised by:** Greg.
- **Why:** Both already have source material in the repo:
  - Shubham Dwivedi: `sources/shubham-dwivedi-iterate-to-destination.md` - validates the Iterate to the Destination pattern.
  - Chris Gallivan: `sources/chris-gallivan-ai-reads-tools-copy.md`.
- **Open questions:** What is the ask (credit/permission, review, co-authoring a pattern)? Which patterns does each tie to?
- **Status:** Not started.
